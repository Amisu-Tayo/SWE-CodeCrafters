<p style="color:black;font-family:lucida;font-size:160%";>plant disease, an impairment of the normal state of a plant that interrupts or modifies its vital functions.<br> All species of plants, wild and cultivated alike, are subject to disease. Although each species is susceptible to</br>characteristic diseases,these are, in each case, relatively few in number. The occurrence and prevalence of</br>plant diseases vary from season to season, depending on the presence of the pathogen, environmental</br>conditions, and the crops and varieties grown. Some plant varieties are particularly subject to outbreaks</br>of diseases while others are more resistant to them. See also list of plant diseases.</p>
